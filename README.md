##Graph of places I'd like to visit with flight cost comparison

A D3 data vis of my vacation wish list. There's so many places to go, so I'm building this tool to help me reach the 30 countries under 30 goal!

##What is this?

D3 has a reputation for having a steep learning curve, I want to scale the curve with this project. I am going to chart the places I want to visit and compare them with flight costs obtained from the [QPX Express API](https://developers.google.com/qpx-express/).

##My Tools

Built with JavaScript, D3 and the QPX API. Plus my old friend, Sass and new buddy Gulp.
